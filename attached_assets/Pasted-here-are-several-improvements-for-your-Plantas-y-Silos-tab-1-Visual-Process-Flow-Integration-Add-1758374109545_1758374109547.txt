here are several improvements for your "Plantas y Silos" tab:
1. Visual Process Flow Integration
Add a visual pipeline view showing the grain's journey through your plant:
CopyReception → Drying → Storage → Milling → Dispatch
This helps operators understand where each silo fits in the process and the current status of grain batches.
2. Enhanced Silo Cards with Real-time Status
Current State Indicators:

Temperature & Humidity sensors (critical for grain quality)
Active processes (drying in progress, aeration running, fumigation scheduled)
Quality alerts (moisture exceeding threshold, temperature rising)
Time in silo (days since oldest batch entered)

Visual Improvements:
CopySilo A-1 [ALMACENAMIENTO]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🌡️ 22°C | 💧 13.5% | 🌬️ Aeration ON
⚠️ Batch r1 approaching 30-day limit
[Progress bar: 45% full]
3. Batch Management Enhancements
Add Critical Information:

Quality parameters: Moisture %, broken grain %, impurities %
Certification status: Organic, conventional, special requirements
Origin traceability: Link to e-Remito, producer info
Aging indicator: Color-coded by days in storage
Cost tracking: Storage cost accumulation per batch

4. Smart Transfer (Trasiego) System
Enhance the modal with:

Compatibility checker: Alert if mixing different varieties/qualities
Quality prediction: Show resulting quality after blend
Cost impact calculator: Display storage/handling costs
Transfer history: Previous movements of selected batches
Regulatory compliance: Automatic validation against certification requirements

Add transfer strategies:
Copy□ FIFO (First In, First Out) - Default
□ LIFO (Last In, First Out)
□ Quality-based (Highest quality first)
□ Customer-specific blend recipe
□ Minimize quality degradation
5. Operations Dashboard
Add a command center view:
Copy┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PLANTA SAMAN - PANEL DE CONTROL     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Receiving Queue: 3 trucks waiting   │
│ Active Drying: Silo C-2 (2h remain) │
│ Pending Orders: 5 (450 tons)        │
│ Quality Alerts: 1 (Silo A-1)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
6. Predictive Analytics Features

Optimal storage duration calculator: Based on moisture and temperature
Deterioration risk score: ML model predicting quality loss
Optimal dispatch scheduling: Match quality degradation with order requirements
Capacity planning: Forecast storage needs based on harvest schedule

7. Integration Points
Connect with:

Scale/weighbridge system: Auto-update quantities
Lab results: Direct quality parameter input
Order management: Show committed vs available inventory
Financial system: Real-time cost tracking

8. Mobile-First Improvements
For plant operators using tablets/phones:

Quick actions bar: Common tasks (transfer, sample, inspect)
QR/Barcode scanning: Quick silo/batch identification
Voice notes: Record observations during inspections
Offline mode: Critical functions available without connection

9. Compliance & Audit Trail

Certification tracking: Display required vs completed processes
Document attachment: Lab results, inspection reports
Change log: Who moved what, when, and why
Regulatory reports: One-click generation for authorities

10. Advanced Silo Management
Add these features:
javascriptCopy// Example enhanced silo object
{
  silo: {
    id: "A-1",
    type: "storage",
    capacity: 10000,
    current_load: 4500,
    batches: [...],
    sensors: {
      temperature: [22.5, 23.1, 22.8], // multiple points
      humidity: 13.5,
      co2_level: 450,
      last_reading: "2024-03-14T10:30:00"
    },
    maintenance: {
      last_fumigation: "2024-02-15",
      next_scheduled: "2024-03-20",
      aeration_hours: 156
    },
    quality_trends: {
      moisture_change: -0.2, // % per week
      broken_grain_increase: 0.1
    },
    alarms: {
      high_temp: {threshold: 28, enabled: true},
      high_moisture: {threshold: 14, enabled: true}
    }
  }
}
11. Smart Notifications System

Temperature exceeding safe limits
Batch approaching maximum storage time
Quality degradation detected
Maintenance required
Order fulfillment opportunities

12. Improved UI Layout

These improvements would transform your system from a simple inventory tracker to a comprehensive grain management platform similar to advanced WMS (Warehouse Management Systems) used in logistics, but tailored for grain processing requirements.
